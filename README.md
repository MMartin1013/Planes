# Planes

## Introduction 

This Planes project was one of the things I worked on during college and we had to create a Python class of Planes and Hangars where they would be stationed and a Plane Error class to check for errors in the initialization of the classes. The planes are meant to be compared to each other for equality.

## Technologies

* Python
* Error Handling

## What I've learned

While making the GameWorld I improved my Python syntax, commenting skills, class understanding, and error handling skills.  This project may have been small but it helped me improve the foundation of my skills in Python.
